					<h1>Rules</h1>
						The quest: Two players each with an army and a stack of tiles try to conquer the playing field in a variety of ways. By the end of the game the ruler with the most points at the end wins.<br><br>
						<list>
							Materials: 
							•	Playing board<br>
							•	160 game tiles<br>
							•	8 character tiles<br>
							•	34 Altering tiles<br>
							•	81 Building tiles<br>
							•	37 Gold tiles<br>
							•	8 Knights, 12 infantry, 2 Kings<br> 
							•	2 Tile holders<br>
							•	2 Baggies<br><br>
						</list>

						Preparing for Battle: Place all character tiles in one baggie, shake it. Each player draws from the baggie to determine his or her character avatar. The character tile will define the player’s special ability and color of pieces. Light pieces move first. (If both players pull out a character with same color the number on the left will determine who goes first. The smallest number goes first.)
						After characters have been decided, remove the others out of play.
							<br><br>Next is to distribute the rest of the playing tiles between each player. There are a 152 playing tiles total, each playing gets 76 tiles. Take all the tiles and lay them all face down. Mix them as best as you can. After that, each player chooses 76 of those tiles and places them in his or her baggie (without looking at the tile). 
						When all the tiles are distributed, next, is to set up the army pieces. Each player can set up their army piece anyway they choose in the formation ground. 
						Below are a couple examples: <br><br>

						Battle: Since light pieces move first he or she has a choice to make. A player can move
